What is this project about?
---------------------------

The JSON discoverer is a tool that allows you to get the implicit schema of your JSON documents. The tool also supports the discovery of composition links among the elements of the schemas of several APIs.

The tool is inspired in the research papers [Discovering Implicit Schemas in JSON Data](http://hal.inria.fr/docs/00/81/89/45/PDF/icwe2013-CanovasCabot.pdf) and [Composing JSON-based Web APIs](http://modeling-languages.com/composing-json-based-web-apis/) published in the [ICWE'13 conference](http://icwe2013.webengineering.org/) and [ICWE'14 conference](http://icwe2014.webengineering.org/), respectively.
