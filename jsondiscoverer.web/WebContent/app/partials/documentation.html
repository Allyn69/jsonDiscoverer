					With the emergence of the Web 2.0, asynchronous-based web technologies are becoming mainstream mainly thanks to their ability to provide richer, faster and more interactive web experiences. For a long time, these applications have been using XML as interchange format, however, in the last years the JavaScript Object  Notation (<a href="http://json.org/>">JSON</a>) has been gaining in popularity since it provides a lightweigth data exchange format with a significant performance improvement.
					</p>
					<p>
					JSON consists in sets of Object described by name/value pairs. It is <strong>schemaless</strong>, i.e., there is no a structural definition of JSON objects, instead it is implicit. Schemaless data is particularly <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/schemaless">interesting in cases dealing with non-uniform data or in schema migration</a>, however, it can become a burden in data integration scenarios (e.g., consuming JSONbased APIs) where it becomes necessary to discover at least partially the underlying structure in order to properly process the data.
					</p>
					<p>
					Nowadays, a considerable number of web applications provide an external API consisting in a set of JSON-based services where all services are interrelated. Indeed, each service gives access to a subset of the application domain and developers must combine them to build any kind of non-trivial functionality on top of that API. Since JSON data is a schemaless format, deducing the right way of combining those services is not a trivial task. JSONDiscoverer aims at discovering (and visualizing) the implicit schema of the JSON data as well as the possible composition links among JSON-based Web APIs.

					<p>The information you are going to find here is a summary of the following research publications:</p>

				<div class="col-md-6">
					<p>The figure on the right illustrates the typical development scenario where JSON-based Web APIs define a set of services, each one returning JSON documents when they are called.</p>
					<p>To select and use these Web APIs, developers usually test each service and reverse engineering the implicit structure of the data they return. When developers want to compose Web APIs, they look for common elements among the Web APIs, which is not a trivial task and sometimes not possible (i.e., when the APIs cannot be composed).</p>
					<p>Our tool applies a discovery process to uncover the data model (i.e., schema) behind JSON-based Web APIs and assist on the discovery of composition links among them. These are currently the main functionalities provided:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong><a href="#/simple">Simple discovery</a></strong>, which discovers the schema of a given set of JSON documents returned by a single service.
						<li><strong><a href="#/advanced">Advanced discovery</a></strong>, which discovers the schema from a set of JSON-based services. First, the schema of each JSON-based service is discovered (by using the simple discoverer), then the resulting schemas are composed to obtain a general one.
						<li><strong><a href="#/composer">API Composer</a></strong>, which takes a set of API schemas, looks for composition links (i.e., common concepts or attributes) and generates a composition graph. The result is used to help developers to compose APIs. The tool currently incoporates a sequence diagram generator to visualize API compositions.

					<p>Our tool draws schema information as UML class diagrams, including concepts (i.e., classes) and their properties (i.e., attributes and associations linking the different concepts). Potential API compositions are represented by means of UML sequence diagrams showing the possible sequence of API calls.

				<h2 id="doc-simple">The Simple Discoverer</h2>
				<div class="col-md-12">
					<p>JSON documents include both metadata (i.e., the name side of the name/value pair elements) and data (i.e., their value). Note that, however, two objects in the same (or different) JSON document(s) generated by a call to the same service do not necessarily have the same exact structure, e.g., it is possible that some of them include only a subset of the metadata/data, thus removing some name/value pairs (e.g., to reduce network traffic). Therefore, the accuracy of the simple discovery increases when a number of JSON objects to infer their common structure are analyzed.</p>
					
					<p>The simple discovery process is therefore launched for each JSON object and has two execution modes: creation and refinement. The former creates a root class from an object representing a concept not yet existing in the service schema created so far whereas the latter enriches/refines an already existing class with information coming from new objects representing such concept. </p>
					
					<p>When a JSON object representing a new concept is considered, the following creation rules are applied to build the corresponding elements in the schema (see figure on the left as example):</p>

				<div class="col-md-7">
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Rule C1</strong>. A JSON object generates a class. The class is named after the JSON service name. The properties (i.e., attributes and associations) of the class are created from the name/value elements included in the JSON object according to rules C3, C4 and C5.</li>

						<li><strong>Rule C2</strong>. A JSON object included in the value side of a name/value generates a class. The class is named after the name side value of the name/value. The properties of the class are created from the name/value elements included in the JSON object according to rules C3, C4 and C5.</li>

						<li><strong>Rule C3</strong>. A JSON name/value element with a value representing a primitive type (i.e., String, Number or Boolean elements) generates an attribute. The name of the attribute is obtained from the name side value of the name/value element and the type is the one corresponding to the primitive type in the class diagram.</li>

						<li><strong>Rule C4</strong>. A JSON name/value element with a non-primitive value element generates a single-valued association. The name of the associations is obtained from the name side value of the name/value element. If the JSON object referred represents a new concept, the association type will be the one resulting from mapping the Object by applying rule C2. Otherwise, the object element has been previously mapped and the resulting class must be refined (see refining rules R1-R3 below).</li>

				<h2 id="doc-advanced">The Advanced Discoverer</h2>
				<div class="col-md-12">
					<p>Many applications provide a complete JSON-based API, including several complementary services, each one offering a distinct viewpoint on the application data. The advanced discoverer is able to obtain a composite model including each single service viewpoint. The resulting model will therefore provide a general overview of the application domain.</p>
					<p>To be able to compose a set of models coming from different services, it is necessary that such models share some elements, thus allowing establishing semantic relationships among them. Note that the discovery of differences and similaritires (i.e., correspondences) between models is not an easy task since it relies on model matching, which can be reduced to the problem of finding correspondences between two graphs (i.e., graph isomorphism). This problem has been proved as NP-hard and the available approaches can only approximate the exact solution.</p>
					<p>The advanced discovery process starts by first creating a new model being the union of all the service-specific models. From there, the following rules try to link/merge the different submodels (see figure at the bottom as example):</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Rule M1</strong>. Two classes <code>c1</code> and <code>c2</code> contained in different schemas represent the same concept if <code>c1.name = c2.name</code>. The classes will be merged into a new one called <code>c</code> where <code>c.name = c1.name</code>. The properties of <code>c</code> will initially be the union of the properties of <code>c1</code> and <code>c2</code> (further matching rules on them may apply).</li>

						<li><strong>Rule M2</strong>. Two attributes <code>a1</code> and <code>a2</code> are defined to be the same if they are contained in a class representing the same concept (see rule M1) and <code>a1.name = a2.name</code>. The two attributes will be merged into a new one called <code>a</code> where <code>a.name = a1.name</code>. The type of <code>a</code> will be <code>a1.type</code> if <code>a1.type = a2.type</code>, or the more general otherwise. Regarding the cardinality of <code>a</code>, the lower bound will be set to the lowest of <code>a1.lowerCardinality</code> and <code>a2.lowerCardinality</code> while the upper bound will be set to the highest of <code>a1.upperCardinality</code> and <code>a2.upperCardinality</code>.</li>

						<li><strong>Rule M3</strong>. Two attributes <code>a1</code> and <code>a2</code>, where <code>a.name != a1.name</code>, are considered the same if they are contained in a class representing the same concept (see rule M1) and there are matching values in the JSON value/pair elements. The two attributes will be merged into a single one <code>a</code> where <code>a.name = a1.name</code> and both the type and cardinality will be inferred as done in rule M2.</li>

						<li><strong>Rule M4</strong>. Two associations <code>r1</code> and <code>r2</code> are considered the same if they are contained in a class representing the same concept (see rule M1) and <code>r1.name = r2.name</code>. The type of <code>r</code> will be <code>r1.type</code> if <code>r1.type = r2.type</code>, otherwise an error will be raised. Regarding the cardinality of <code>r</code>, the lower bound will be set to the lowest of <code>r1.lowerCardinality</code> and <code>r2.lowerCardinality</code> while the upper bound will be set to the highest of <code>r1.upperCardinality</code> and <code>r2.upperCardinality</code>.</li>

					<p>The API composer applies a discovery process which first analyzes the schema behind each involved API (using the simple and advanced discoverers) and then takes the discovered schemas to obtain composition links.

					<p>Composition links among APIs are discovered by means of matching concepts among their schemas and analyzing whether they are part of the input parameters of API services. We have currently defined the following rules:</p>

						<li><strong>Rule C2</strong>. As a class can represent several JSON objects, only class properties found in every JSON object will be considered (calculated by the metadata generated by the advanced discoverer).</li>
						<li><strong>Rule C3</strong>. Two properties <code>a1</code> and <code>a2</code> are considered as similar if <code>a1.name = a2.name</code> and <code>a1.type = a2.type</code>. Otherwise heuristics based on their name/type may be applied (e.g., the number of matching letters in their names must be higher than a given threshold). </li>
						<li><strong>Rule C4</strong>. Two classes <code>c1</code> and <code>c2</code> contained in different API schemas are similar if they contain a number of similar properties higher than a given threshold.</li>
						<li><strong>Rule C5</strong>. There exists a composition link between two classes <code>c1</code> and <code>c2</code> contained in different API schemas if they are the same (or similar) and <code>c2</code> is an input concept.

					<p>Composition links plus the API schemas can be used to render a graph where nodes represent classes/attributes and edges represent composition links or attribute composition. The figure on the left shows an example. Colored nodes in the graph represent the classes used in each API. Blue nodes represent the classes used as input to call an API. White nodes represent attributes of the classes. Nodes are connected by directed edges represented by arrows, which can link nodes from the same or different APIs. Nodes from the same API are linked when there is an association between the classes in the API schema, whereas nodes from different APIs are linked when a composition link has been detected.</p>

					<p>Paths in the composition graph can be used to assist developers in the composition of APIs. To calculate a path, developers must specify both the information they can provide (by selecting the concepts/attributes they have available) and what they want to get (by selecting the desired concepts/attributes). Well-known graph algorithms can then be applied to calculate paths (if exist) among the selected nodes. </p>
					<p>A path crossing nodes from different APIs can allow specifying the steps a developer has to follow to compose them. This path can be represented as a sequence diagram which specifies the calls and parameters to be used. Sequence diagrams can be drawn following these rules (see Figure below as example):</p>
					<ul>
						<li>There will be as many actors as APIs are traversed by the path plus the actor representing the developer.</li>
						<li>The diagram will include as many synchronous calls as APIs are traversed by the path. </li>
						<li>A method call will be included for each API crossed. The method call will be named as the first node of the sub-path traversing the involved API and the parameters are the attributes of the concept. The method will return the set of attributes of the ending node of the sub-path.</li>
						<li>If the sub-path traversing an API includes a multivalued association, the call resulting from such path will be a loop.</li>
						<li>A mapping between the data returned and the input parameters of intermediate method calls will be provided as annotation.</li>

				<h2 id="doc-backend">The Backend</h2>
				<div class="col-md-12">
					<p>The tool provides a Java-based backend, which implements the functionalities commented before The main classes included in the backend are shown in the figure below. The backend defines a set of classes to represent JSON documents (see <code>AbstractJsonSource</code> hierarchy) returned by JSON-based Web services. They are called JSON sources and range from single JSON documents (i.e., <code>SingleJsonSource</code>) to a set of them (i.e., <code>JsonSourceSet</code>). JSON sources can also define the input of the service (i.e., <code>withInput</code>) if it is given as a JSON document. The parsing and management of JSON data is performed by using the <a href="https://github.com/google/gson">GSON library</a>. </p>
					<p>The main functionalities provided by the tool are implemented in their corresponding classes. The simple discoverer is implemented by the classes <code>JsonSimpleDiscoverer</code> and <code>JsonInjector</code>, which provide the discovery of the schema and the data model, respectively. The advanced discoverer is implemented by the classes <code>JsonAdvancedDiscoverer</code>. Finally, the API composer is implemented by the class <code>JsonComposer</code>. Other classes not included in the Figure for the sake of simplicity are in charge of managing the coverage information, the management of models (i.e., loading and saving) and the sequence diagram generator. Our solution leverages on the modeling technology to represent the API schemas and the data models. In particular, the tool uses the <a href="https://eclipse.org/modeling/emf/">Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF)</a></code>. 
					<p>The backend is made web-accessible by means of a set of servlets giving access to the classes implementing the core functionalities. The resulting web API allows using the developed service on any website. The first use of this web API is this webpage itself. </p>
